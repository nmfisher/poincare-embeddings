# poincare-embedding

This is a fork of https://github.com/TatsuyaShirakawa/poincare-embedding, which was designed to train word embeddings from WordNet pairs.

This implementation allows training word embeddings on arbitrary text files using either the [continuous-bag-of-words or skipgram models](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/lecture_notes/notes1.pdf). 

I eventually plan to combine this with [Facebook's fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) (e.g. char-ngrams), but so far there have only been a few minor additions.

## Build

* gcc-4.6.3 / CMake 3 or newer.

```shell
cd poincare-embedding
mkdir work & cd work
cmake ..
make
```

## Run

```
poincare-embedding/work/poincare-embedding [input_file] [output_file] -arg1 -arg2.....
```

The executable accepts any text file consisting of words separated by a space (i.e. sentences). For each word in the text file, the Poincare model is then trained on a sliding window to the left and right of that word. The model will train across sentence boundaries (e.g. full-stops) but not across newlines.
